# MicroPython Requirements for Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W Race Controller
# Install these packages using upip on the device

# MQTT client for AWS IoT Core
micropython-umqtt.simple

# Additional useful packages (optional)
micropython-logging  # Enhanced logging (if needed)

# Note: The following are built-in to MicroPython and don't need installation:
# - asyncio (built-in async support)
# - json (built-in JSON handling)
# - ssl (built-in SSL/TLS)
# - network (built-in WiFi support)
# - machine (built-in hardware control)
# - time (built-in time functions)

# Installation commands to run on Pico 2 W:
# >>> import upip
# >>> upip.install('micropython-umqtt.simple')

# For development/testing on PC with regular Python:
# asyncio
# json
# ssl
# time
